# Happy Sad Model

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify images as happy or sad.

## Getting Started

To use this model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Akshaj31/Happy-Sad-Model.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the model: python predict.py <path_to_image>

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is defined in `Image Classification.ipynb`. It consists of three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, a flatten layer, and two dense layers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model can be found at `data`. It contains images labeled as happy or sad.

## Training

To train the model, run the jupyter notebook. You can customize the training parameters in the script.

## Evaluation

Evaluation metrics and results can also be found in the same notebook.
